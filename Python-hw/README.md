## Instructions to this task

In this week your task is to create docker image + container basing on this simple code

This application is a simple REST API web-server, which gives you response "/", "/hello", "/json" paths. Check code to see which of this paths returns.

If you done it right, you may check correct responses using **curl**: for example, your_server_ip:5000/hello must return message "Hello, World!"

**Note**: before conterize this code, analyze it.
